Mixr Recipe App - Tracey Hill

Uses the Gatsby/React to create a web-app with typescript support. 
> yarn add global gatsby-cli //added the CLI globally via yarn

Gatsby is used to build static Web Apps that follow the latest web standards, and are optimized to be highly performant. I chose Gatsby over Next.js based on speed. It is faster because there is no render time ans it is all pre rendered then delivered from a local cached cdn. Popular sites that use this React.js framework are, AirBnB.io, spotify, meetup and Nike campaigns site. 

ESLint is enabled to find code problems and being run as part of the Mixr's continuous integration pipeline.
Prettier is enabled for code formatting.

Developed in VS Code on Windows 10 with:

Node 12.18.4
npm 6.14.6
gatsby-cli version 2.18.0

Pushed initial app to GitHub at https://github.com/tracey-web/mixr
> git remote add origin https://github.com/tracey-web/mixr.git git branch -M main git push -u origin main

Installed Material-UI - React UI Library
> yarn add @material-ui/core
> yarn add @material-ui/styles

This project was bootstrapped with Gatsby framework template.
> gatsby new mixr gatsby new mixr https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
